<h1 id="john-oliver-secondary-the-next-generation">John Oliver Secondary: The Next Generation</h1>
<p>Over the course of human history, the scope of an educational institute has evolved. In early human history, formal education was limited to the highest echelons of society. Today, formal education is a fundamental right available to every person.</p>
<p>As a result, the purpose of education has expanded from learning to a phase of life.</p>
<p>To this end, here are a list of proposed additions:</p>
<h3 id="retail-space">Retail Space</h3>
<p>Primarily, and perhaps most controversial will be the construction of retail space on the east side of the lot. This space will be rented to local businesses, and the income will be managed by an independent trust. The revenue will go towards supporting various school programs. In addition, preferences would be given to businesses who could accommodate student internships/coops.</p>
<h3 id="athleticsa-collaboration-with-translink">Athletics/A collaboration with Translink</h3>
<p>The lack of adequate athletic facilities at John Oliver is a real problem. However, the size and cost of many of these facilities makes constructing many of them impractical. An alternative is a partnership with Translink to secure transport to local public facilities. John Oliver is situated in the center of a web of fantastic public facilities:</p>

<h3 id="performing-arts">Performing Arts</h3>
<p>While public facilities are subsidized by taxpayer funds, performing centres are private and thus costly to use. Fortunately, since cost is no object, a country class auditorium will be constructed, not only for educational use; but as a low-cost rental space to the public.</p>
<h3 id="an-enhanced-vln">An enhanced VLN</h3>
<p>Several courses at John Oliver have been planned, but cancelled due to low enrollment. Partnering with VLN  to offer the course to students over the entire district could solve that problem.</p>
<h3 id="the-learning-commons">The Learning Commons</h3>
<p>I think the learning commons is underappreciated. The new library will have a rooftop patio, study rooms, and more technology.</p>
<h3 id="mini-school--stem">Mini School &amp; STEM</h3>
<p>I feel that the greatest strength of the stem and mini program is the sense of closeness it creates. Being in more classes and the field trips and having all these novel experiences is amazing.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think a separate building is the correct decision. Instead, some rooms will be set aside exclusively for the mini school.</p>
