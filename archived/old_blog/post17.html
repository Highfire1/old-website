<p>Recently, a post of this image, titled <em>Recent mudslide on Hwy 99 started at non-deactivated logging road from a 1991 cutblock</em> garnered over 1100 upvotes on the r/vancouver subreddit.<br>

<p>Though the debacle of unmaintained logging roads is definitely a target of debate, what I find more interesting is the source of the photo: The Ministry of Transportation’s Flickr page. On their page is photos from all across British Columbia. I just think its neat to be able to see the direct efforts of an entire arm of the government.</p>
