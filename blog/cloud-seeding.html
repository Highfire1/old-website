<h3 id="a-local-perspective">A Local Perspective</h3>
<p>In 2001, BC Hydro commissioned a study on cloud seeding. The exact contents of this study are a mystery, so we can only speculate towards their contents. However, two years later the provincial Weather Modification Act was repealed. The implications are unclear, but they are certainly intriguing. <a href="https://lailayuile.com/2011/07/28/why-did-the-bc-government-repeal-the-weather-modification-act/">[1]</a></p>
<h3 id="a-tantalizing-option">A Tantalizing Option</h3>
<p>Earth is certainly no stranger to cloud seeding. Cloud seeding has been ongoing for over 80 years and today cloud seeding is taking place in over 50 countries. <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/resources/bulletin/seeding-change-weather-modification-globally">[2]</a></p>
<p>China spends about $200 million per year on cloud seeding efforts and reports an increase in rainfall of 10-15%; an extra 50 billion cubic metres of water every year. <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/03/25/cloud-seeding-will-not-solve-chinas-water-shortages">[3]</a><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/melinda-liu-can-china-control-olympics-weather-110875">[4]</a></p>
<p>In the United Arab Emirates, deteriorating groundwater and high costs of desalination make cloud seeding an attractive option; expenditures are unavailable but 242 cloud seeding flights were conducted in 2017. UAE also funds a $5 million grant every year to <em>“research projects in the field of rain enhancement”</em>. <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/environment/how-does-cloud-seeding-in-the-uae-work-1.811961">[5]</a><a href="https://www.uaerep.ae/">[6]</a></p>
<p>Several states in America conduct cloud seeding. Among others, California, Colorado, and North Dakota have all established economic benefits from cloud seeding. <a href="https://www.skywaterventures.com/uploads/7/0/6/1/70616003/cec-500-2007-008.pdf">[7]</a><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04032020/cloud-seeding-global-warming/">[8]</a><a href="https://www.swc.nd.gov/arb/ndcmp/economic.html">[9]</a></p>
<h3 id="concerns">Concerns</h3>
<p>Cloud seeding is very much an evolving field (several sources in this text are from 2021) and questions remain on several fronts:</p>
<p>Two studies have found silver iodide to lack toxicity towards humans, but toxicity to other organisms is unquantified until more research is conducted. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3ZFpUZFSFo&amp;list=PLjiR9sMNwZoDelYr_xW3sjLMeZM-lR86N&amp;index=130">[10]</a></p>
<p>Concerns about stealing water have been made and rebuffed by several meteorologists in the media. Unfortunately, I cannot find any peer-reviewed studies to back up either argument.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3>
<p>With all this taken into account, I do believe that cloud seeding is a viable option for governments to use.</p>
<p>The underlying issue, however, is climate change.</p>
<p>In the UAE, groundwater is being depleted faster than it is being recharged. This is exacerbated by one of the highest per capita water consumption rates in the world: 477 cubic metres per day, per person. This has forced the government to source 40 percent of its fresh water from costly, energy guzzling desalination plants. <a href="https://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-tenders/article-33309-groundwater-depletion-risks-land-subsidence-in-uae">[11]</a> <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/united-arab-emirates-water#:~:text=The%20UAE%20has%20one%20of,for%20water%20and%20energy%20projects.">[12]</a> <a href="https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/environment-and-energy/water-and-energy/water-">[13]</a></p>
<p>In Maharashtra, India, the government hired a cloud seeding company (aside: this is the very same company that BC Hydro hired) only after three consecutive years of drought slashed agricultural output by 33%. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-cloud-seeding-india/">[14]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The human impact has been severe—1,300 debt-trapped farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra in just the past six months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Globally, cleantech startups raised <strong>16 billion dollars</strong> in the first half of 2021 alone. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/climate-startups-are-booming-as-vcs-throw-money-at-cleantech">[15]</a></p>
<p>As we approach 2 degrees, the stability of our climate will only continue degrading. Cloud seeding is a solution to only the symptoms of climate change. Without greater changes in society, cloud seeding may prove ultimately useless.</p>
