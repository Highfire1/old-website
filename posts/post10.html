<p>A fantastic consequence of the age of the internet is access to information. When I heard the name, “The Polaris Institute”, I had to investigate what exactly they entailed.</p>
<p>I think there’s something poignant in the way that the last post on the Polaris Institute page is from 2015.</p>
<p>I think there’s something poignant about how there’s a for lease sign outside of Polaris Institute’s address.</p>
<p>I think there’s something poignant about the two people who edited  the Polaris Institute’s Wikipedia page at the start of this year.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
