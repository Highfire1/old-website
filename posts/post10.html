<p>A fantastic consequence of the age of the internet is access to information. When I heard the name, “The Polaris Institute”, I had to investigate what exactly they entailed.</p>
<p>I think there’s something poignant in the way that the last post on the Polaris Institute page is from 2015.</p>
<p>I think there’s something poignant about how there’s a  <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.4170716,-75.6944615,3a,75.5y,295.24h,89.16t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sPs_jGo-8nvMrLrBXgoGrTQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DPs_jGo-8nvMrLrBXgoGrTQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D156.71986%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192">for lease sign</a> outside of Polaris Institute’s address.</p>
<p>I think there’s something poignant about the two people who edited the Polaris Institute’s Wikipedia page at the start of this year.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
