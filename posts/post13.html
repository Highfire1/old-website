<p>An interesting issue I came across while researching cloud seeding:</p>
<p>How do you tell the truth? Take for example this quote from an <a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/industries-culture-society/revealed-558-000-spent-on-uae-cloud-seeding-operations-last-year-629970#.V2vYVOSJ3Ao">Saudi Arabian newspaper (2016)</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="stacked">
<p><strong>Desalinating one cubic metre of water from the sea costs $60</strong>, whereas the same amount of water extracted through <strong>cloud seeding costs just $1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds too good to be true right?</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from a <a href="https://www.advisian.com/en/global-perspectives/the-cost-of-desalination">consulting company (~2015)</a> on the cost of desalination plants:</p>
<blockquote class="stacked">
<p>The average costs, represented by the best fit line in the data shown, are about <strong>$0.70/m3</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who’s telling the truth?</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from the <a href="https://www.skywaterventures.com/uploads/7/0/6/1/70616003/cec-500-2007-008.pdf">US Bureau of Reclamation (2007)</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="stacked">
<p>The California DWR has estimated that an additional 300,000–400,000 ac‐ft of new supply could be realized by seeding, with an investment of around $7 million (DWR 2005). This represents a cost of about <strong>$19 per ac‐ft</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the metric-minded, an ac-ft is about 1300 m3.</p>
<p>Wait, that’s a cost of 0.015 $ per m3!?</p>
<p>What do you do when three separate, reliable sources disagree completely?<br>

There is no resolution here, only suffering lol</p>
