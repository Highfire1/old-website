<p>Let us talk today about food. Here in the pacific northwest, one of our main culinary products is seafood, ranging from salmon, crabs, shrimps, eels, etc.</p>
<p>However, these products would quickly become unappetizing without imports from other regions. Wheat from Alberta is required to make breading, canola oil from Saskatchewan for frying, fruits and vegetables from the Interior, and so in and so forth.</p>
<p>The point that is buried somewhere beneath these ill thought out food analogies is that democracy, much like cuisine <strong>must</strong> take into account the differing economic and cultural values of different regions in order to be a representative government.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
