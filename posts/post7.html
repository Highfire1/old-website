<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions. This is true in light of certain recent classroom events but also true, I think, of the greater world.</p>
<p>I would like to think that the one percent who contribute as much carbon emissions as the other 50 percent of the world don’t want to make the earth uninhabitable. So why are we still on track for a 2 degree increase?</p>
<p>It’s capitalism. We can pin this on heartless corporate boards or profit driven hedge funds all we want but the underlying system is still capitalism.</p>
<p>Good intentions? Bill Gates, perhaps the most well known philanthropist ever, has a blog. <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/">Check it out!</a> Maybe the good intentions there can save Earth?</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say here is that I have absolutely no clue. Sure, we can become socialists, eat the rich and dismantle the institution! But these solutions don’t work. People from all walks of life, whether they be smarter, richer, more connected, or more experienced have all tried or are currently trying within the public purview and if their plans worked we certainly wouldn’t still be on track for two degrees.</p>
<p>Exercise your democratic freedoms you say? British Columbia holds 36 seats in the House of Commons. The entire province could decide to vote Green in the next election and it would not change the bills that pass in Ottawa.</p>
<p>I like to think we’re all decent people. But as it is, I don’t see how we’re going to save ourselves.</p>
